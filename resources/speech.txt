My name is Eren Yeager. I now speak to all the Subjects of Ymir, by way of the Founding Titan's power. 
Every wall on the island of Paradis has been unhardened. The Titans buried within them have begun to walk.
My goal is to protect the people of Paradis, who bore, and raised me.
But the world desires the extinction of the people of Paradis. Over countless years, their hatred has grown beyond this island. They surely will not stop until they have killed every last one of our people.
I reject their desire.
The Titans of the Walls will trample and rumble all the lands beyond this island.
Until the lives there are eliminated from this world!
